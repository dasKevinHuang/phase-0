      Everyone's been there. You and your friends find a magical pair of pants, on the last summer before college. That might be a book. Anyway, you all want these pants, to work them, show off how fantastic they make you look. What if the pants were a piece of code? Maybe a fashion app? You all love it, want to work, but unlike pants, you can all work on it at once! How does <i>this</i> magic work? Version control! It's this magical ability to have a central file, and everyone can control their own version.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>What are the benefits of version control?</b>
       <br/>Well, say you're writing code for a pants design app. Becky can write the section on bedazzling and merge it with the larger files. At the same time, Paula can present her code regarding plotting pleats in pants. The real benefit is allowing everyone to create versions separately, on their own local machines, and merge them into one document.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
       <br/>Now, git is your new coding best friend when it comes to version control. It keeps track of the changes you've made. If a file is changed, saved again, new folders made, it keeps track. Anytime you are in your repository [The place where you store your code], you can check your git status by typing just that. You know quickly what changes have been made. Then you just type git add and tell them which file you are ready to commit [which means to make it the master copy as it were], and commit them each.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
       <br/>GitHub is really well structured to work alongside your git. It also allows for cross-Internet collaboration. As well, GitHub enables others to view your code, offer suggestions and to allow you to see others work and use them to improve or assist your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>That's why we do this!</b>
        <br/>Dev Bootcamp is an environment where everyone wants everyone to succeed. Using version control, git and GitHub to enchance our communication and our community is just one step in creating greatness!
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Thanks for reading!</b>
       <br/>Have a fantastic day!

  <h1>Week 1 (Version Control/git/GitHub)</h1>
  <h2>An intro to the importance of Version Control, Git, and GitHub</h2>
  <h4>November 16, 2015</h4>
  </header>
    <p>
     Hi there! My name is Kevin Huang. I'm a part of the Squirrels cohort at Dev Bootcamp. In this blog, you will find out about my weekly adventures with Dev Bootcamp and the topics that are being taught! For this blog post I will be introducing you to version control, git and Github - all very important things. Without further ado, let's dive in!
    </p>
    <p>
        First, let's find out what version control is. Version control allows you to track changes that happen to your files and review why, when, and how they happened. This is very important in development because if a random glitch were to be added into code that you wrote, you would want to know why, when, and how that happened. Version control software does all of that for you automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
       Now that we know what version control is, we can dive into version control software, specifically git! Git is a popular version control software that makes it easy for developers to work collaboratively while tracking ANY changes made to their code. With git, developers working together across the world can ensure that they are all working with the exact same file simultaneously. Even if they make changes to that same file, git allows those developers to precisely merge their changes so that all of the work can be unified. Without git doing this for them, developers might accidentally overwrite code that another developer's work. Git is installed locally on your computer and helps you track changes to your code by keeping a log of actions. Any number of actions performed in git can be reversed, so if any mistakes are made, don't worry - you can always undo changes that are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let's find out what GitHub is and why it matters. GitHub is a service that allows your to host and share code on their remote servers, which use git for version control. Because GitHub hosts your folders using git, it's easy to share code and work collaboratively with other developers using its services. GitHub works remotely and automatically tracks any changes with git. GitHub is important because it acts as a social network for development by making it easy to share and work on code in collaboratively on the Internet.

#### What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
A few of the HTML5 tags I used in this challenge in particular were:

<header> - I used this tag quite often because a header is a fairly common part of webpages and content. 
The header element makes it fairly simple to let browsers and search engines know where the header for this page or content lives.
Parsing a data or title should be easy by locating a <header> tag in the page.

<main> - This element is used to contain the main content for a particular page. I use this often since it is pretty useful for structuring where the main content of a page lives. 
I think for this page in particular, it can act as a nice structural element to act as a parent for both blog post articles - so that even though each blog post is in its own article element, the main element still has purpose in organizing them within one area for main content. 
I think with the use of this tag, you can also apply CSS formatting after easily to the main content area.

<article> - This element is used for self-contained articles such as blog posts or news articles that can live on their own and be redistributed. 
I come back to this element often because we've mainly been working on the blog, so this element especially works well for carrying the contents of a blog post itself.
I think this element is especially useful for services that need might need to parse this sort of data to process content, such as search engines, to isolate news-worthy content away from miscellaneous information that might be aside from this article.

I use these three tags quite often especially since their functions are quite common in normal page strucures. 
<section> and <footer> are two tags, although were not used in this challenege, are elements that I use quite often in my HTML. I think <footer> especially is quite useful since footers are a common piece of webpages.

####How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Like the name of this challenge suggests, elements are laid out with a structure like you would think of in the anatomy of a body, separating each part of the page within an element, and then smaller parts as child elements of those.
It starts out of course with a <!DOCTYPE html> and the HTML element as the root of the whole page, to start the page by identifying itself as an HTML document, then using the <HTML> element as a root for everything that is part of the page.
Then the <head> element is a child of <HTML>, and carries its own children - all the meta data that is related to the page that might be important for search enginges, social media serices, and other browsers to process as a part of this website.
After <head>, comes the <body>, which carries in it, everything that will be rendered by the browser for the user to see. Its children will include a number of HTML5 semantic elements such as <header>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, etc. and any other container elements like <div>, <span>, <p>, etc.
I believe the way that browsers display elements is similar to the way that you might see in Chrome Devtools - moving from the top to the bottom, going inside each element, then rendering each child element until there are no more child elements left in that parent. 
At that point, the browser will move onto the next parent element.


####What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I was a little familiar with snippets prior to the challenge, but the challenege really helped me solidify my ability to use them by learning how to access, edit, and create new snippet code.
I think I will definitely continue to create handy snippets ( however I think that manually practicing common code segments will be important at first to save them in muscle memory!).
The most useful function  I've learned from this is definitely the ability to access pre-made snippets in Sublime. I think it will be incredibly useful to customize and update code snippets in sublime for my purposes in the future.
I've also found that sublime has a LOT of snippets already written into it. When I write code in C++ or Ruby for practice, Sublime has no problem keeping up with any function or method that I might be writing and have a template ready to be filled in if I wanted.

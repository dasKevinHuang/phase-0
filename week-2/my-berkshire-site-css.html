<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was rewarding. Being able to use what I've learned from codeacademy to creating a basic website was a good experience.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

We used the img element to incorporate the Geico logo. We also used the title tag in the <head> tag to display the same title as the original website. We also 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We used minimum formatting for the HTML file. The only formatting we used was the <hr> tag which displays a line through each section. This was used to achieve a similar look to the example shown in the lesson. We used an unordered list <ul> and <ls> tags to list all of the links on the original website.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

What’s good about HTML is that it lets you get the structure and information on screen so the user can get an idea of what the page will look like in a relatively fast manner. What’s bad about HTML is that you’re formatting and styling options are limited so you can see what the final product will look like.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

For now I keep a cheatsheet of some HTML tags I want to remember. Also a lot of the tags name hint at what they do (<img><article><li> <p>etc.)

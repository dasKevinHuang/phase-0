####What is a wireframe?

A wireframe serves as an initial prototype for how you would structure a page on your website. It allows developers to work on the visual organization of a website before writing code.

####What are the benefits of wireframing?

Developers benefit from wireframing by being able to think deeply about the structure of what will be built. Wireframing allows teams to arrange elements on a page to whatever best suits their goals and target interest without having already written lines of code for the page. 

Wireframing gives developers another way to narrow and focus in on the overall plan of the site that will be built.

####Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

Yes I did enjoy wireframing my site. I liked how it allowed me to visually illustrate the sort of possibilities I could go with when I actually write and format the site itself. 

I felt that having the ability to build a wireframe without having to commit to several hours of development definitely frees yourself to being able to really devote a part of the thinking process to how my target audience would interface with one design element over another.

####Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

Yes, I revised my wireframe several times. My thinking process ended up going back and forth between two different styles of wireframe structure - one that was more minimalistic and one that had a more structured look.


####What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I found myself asking what do other developers' websites and blogs look like? So I searched for blogs of well-known developers and studied the many different styles of websites/blogs that each of these people employed for themselves. 

I thought it was very interesting to see the different choices that were made by individual developers over the style of their own blogs and how much this varied among personal blogs and websites. This research was very helpful because it allowed me to find inspiration in certain elements that I found appealing in technical blogs.


####Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed putting the wireframes together and thinking through the different pieces of each index wireframe, from the header, to the body, to the footer, piece by piece.

I found the part that was the most tedious to me was thinking and researching about what kind of wireframe would work best for my site. While it was tedious, I enjoyed still enjoyed this part of the challenege.

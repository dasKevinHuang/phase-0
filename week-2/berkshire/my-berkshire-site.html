- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I thought it was a pretty simple! It was nice to be able to discuss HTML with my pair, Roche, and solidify our understanding of HTML concepts into an actual preliminary page. I'm looking forward to formmating the page next week!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It was very informative. There are so many resources for learning HTML online and much of it is well written and well documented. It was not hard to google search for any number of HTML elements to find resources on it.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did ok. Unfortunately, I just realized I actually ended up falling back to habits of doing small formating elements in HTML that I've learned in the past! You can see some of this in the HTML below, I couldn't help but want to format it at least a little bit. Hopefully, we will clean and tidy it up with CSS in next week's challenges.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
I think what's great is that HTML is a very simple markup language to learn. The bad part about HTML is that you can't really do much with ONLY HTML. 

HTML works well in tandem with so many other things like javascript and CSS to make up for it. A website with only HTML will look like something from the early 90's.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I simply remember that HTML has a structure to it - just like an essay would. It has a head, header, body, footer, etc.

###Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

First, to create a repository on GitHub, what you will need to do is sign into your account on Github.com. If you don't already have an account, you can create one now.

Then click on the `+` button on the top right and click `Create Repository`.

Choose a name for your repository - this is the name for your repository so make it special! Keep the `public` tick mark checked. Click `Create repository` on the bottom finish creating your first repository!

Now to clone your repository, you will need to open the `Terminal` program if you are on a Mac. If you are on Windows, you will need to find a similar bash command line program.

Go to the page for your repository on Github.com. If you are having trouble finding it, click your profile icon on the top right and go to your profile. Click the name of your repo from the `Repositories` list. 

Now copy the `HTTPS clone URL` on the middle right side of this page. If you click the clipboard icon, it will do it for you.

Open your `Terminal` program and enter `git clone URLHERE` (Replace `URLHERE` with the URL you just copied from your repo page.) Congratulations! You have just cloned your repo onto your computer.
You can find the repo folder by going to the User folder on your computer - you will see the name of your repo folder inside.

###Describe what open source means.

Open source refers to software that is allowed to be freely distributed. In addition to this, open source software must have its source code included and allow anyone to use and build on the source code.

Developers usually release their software as open source when they want others to share and build on their code. It is also a type of licensing. When a software has an open source license, it will meet the above requirements and many others.

###What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think that Open Source is a great thing for technology and the Internet in general. Open source licensing has allowed for many great works of software to be made publicly available for free. Not only that, but other developers are free to contribute, modify, and build on the work that is released. 

Wordpress, Firefox, VideoLAN, and many many more important and famous projects are open source. Open source does not make me feel nervous or protective at all - in fact it makes me want to contribute to these projects someday hopefully in a meaningful way. 

If I had a project that I wanted to protect, then I would use a different license. One other great thing about Open Source is that if I was struggling with a project that I was working on, I could invite other developers to freely come and contribute code to my project. Better yet, if they can create or modify the project to become even better, they are free to do so as well.

Open source projects are usually released for the greater good and for anybody to enjoy or modify. I think open source does represent a part of the Internet that strives for utopia for the greater good. It's one of the great things about the Internet and has led to amazing works of technological progress.

###Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are important because they provide the developer with control and autonomy over how they want to protect, distribute, or share their work. Open source licensing, in particular, is important because it allows other people to freely contribute code to projects that you might need help with.

A developer can choose the appropriate licensing restrictions for their projects to limit modification, distribution for profit, and even access to the source code. 

###What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The concepts of open source and licensing were solidified a bit more for me with this challenge. The previous challenges did not go into explaining the licenses, so this was refreshing. 

I feel like the "aha" moment I had for this challenge was when I was reading about the different licenses and remembering the names of these licenses flash before me with other programs I've used before. It's sort of amazing how much of a role open source plays in widening the scope of the Internet. I didn't struggle with any part of the challenge, but it was nice practice in relation to the last challenge.

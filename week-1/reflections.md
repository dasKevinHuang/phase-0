# 1.1 Thinking About Time

*Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?*
I learned about the Fogg Method, Time Boxing (especially the Pomodoro Technique), rewards-based habit creation, and the flow.

The idea that was most compelling to me was the Fogg method, which I've heard of before in different forms, but never explained directly by Fogg himself. It sounds like a really convincing way of creating new behaviors through tiny habits. I'd love to try a combination of these techniques together to boost my productivity and time management skills.

Time Boxing, especially through the Pomodoro technique, was very interesting to read about, because I had read briefly in the past about maximizing your attention span by splitting your time into short spurts. By devoting short immersed spurts of time with short breaks in between, you can maximize your productivity rather than burning yourself out over a long period of time. I think combined with the Fogg method, this time boxing could be really productive way to finish tasks that may seem daunting at first.

In the talk with Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi, I learned about different methods for creating habits that have been studied, particularly habit creation alongside rewards. As I was listening to Charles talk about this, the methods he talked about just made sense. It made me remember about the times I've had the right motivation and attitude for finishing tasks, but lacked the right habits for actually doing it. Creating a habit by adding rewards and reflection to small pieces just makes sense and I'd love to try this in addition to the Fogg method.

Lastly, I read about the "flow". It was very eye-opening to actually read and think about the obstacles that block the mind from getting into the flow. I will keep the knowledge of the conditions that are needed to be in the flow in my toolbox, so that I can know how to soothe my way into the flow.

*What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?*
As I explained above, time boxing is a time management method that consists of scheduling short amounts of time for a specific task and stopping whenever the scheduled time has ended - no matter if the task if finished or not. This allows for greater benefits than simply working until a task is completed because it allows for reflection and breaks between time boxes. The pomodoro technique is one way of time boxing, that consists short spurts of time for a task with breaks in between to split up time spent. 

I can use time boxing to be more productive with my work in Phase 0 because rather than tiring myself out by attempting to finish an entire weeks worth of work in one spurt, I can schedule short time boxes where I will be immersed in the work and can break to rest and absorb the information. I believe with this technique, I can maximize my effectiveness and the amount of material I can learn over time.

*How do you manage your time currently?*
I currently manage my time by setting times for specific tasks, however I usually end up working on those tasks until I am finished for long periods of time.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
In some ways, it does work because I am able to finish what I need to do. My strategy does not work so well, however, when I become tired after working on a specific task for a long period of time. This welcomes interruptions and distractions, and I usually do not take the time to rest in the middle of a task.

*Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?*
What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I plan to use to Fogg method, Timeboxing through the Pomodoro Technique, and small rewards based habit creation to manage my time and increase my productivity throughout Phase 0. By using the Fogg Method, I plan on creating a "tiny habit" of doing DBC curriculum every day in the afternoon after I have walked my dog. 

With the Pomodoro technique of timeboxing, I will set 25 minute time periods for myself to work on DBC curriculum, starting with the first 25 minutes after I walked my dog as mentioned before for the Fogg method. After 25 minutes I will take a short 5 minute break, then spend 4 more "pomodoros" learning the DBC curriculum before resting for the night, with breaks in between.

Lastly, I will reinforce productive behaviors behind the habit of studying DBC curriculum everyday, by rewarding myself by playing with my dog during breaks between pomodoros. Playing with my dog between time boxes will allow myself to stay relaxed and stress-free so that I can focus better and stay immersed when I am in the flow.

# 1.2 The Command Line

*What is a shell? What is "bash?"*

To paraphrase the way that Steven Harms described it, a shell is an interface that allows you to interact and direct the processing power of a computer directly. 

"bash" is a shell that can be used as a command line interface to instruct a computer to execute specific commands or processes.

*2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?* 
I think the most challenging part of this material was the video in which Steven Harms gives an introduction to Shell. While it was informative, the pacing felt slow and thus became hard for me to devote my full attention to the video ( especially being at 1 hour long - taking almost 10 minutes just to get to command line). I'm sure for other people it might have been especially helpful, it just didn't work that well for me.

*3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?* 
Yes I was able to use all the commands in my terminal.

*4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?* 
I think -cd, -pwd, and -ls, in my opinion, are probably the most fundamental commands to know, because they are essential to navigating files and folders in a computer. Without knowing these commands, you would not know what directory you are working in, how to change folders, and what files are in the folder you are currently in. Pretty important stuff!

*5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.*
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

Yes! Here they are:

`-pwd`

Abbreviated for "print working directory". -pwd will print the current working directory, or in other words, let you know the current folder that the you are working on in bash.

`-ls`

Executing -ls will list everything that is inside the folder that you are on.

`-mv`

Executing -mv will allow you to rename or move files & directories.

`-cd`

Executing -cd will change the folder that you are working on. Allows you to move and navigate through folders in the command line.

`-../`

"../" is not a command by itself, however if you were to use it with -cd, such as -cd ../, you will move back up one directory. You can stack ../ as much as you want to indicate how many folders you want to move up.

`-touch`

Executing "-touch" will create an empty file.

`-mkdir`

Executing "-mkdir" will create a new directory inside of the folder you are currently working on.

`-less`

Executing "-less" will display a text file by itself - all other previous commands are hidden. You will have to type "q" to exit this viewing mode. You can execute "-more" to display the file in-line with the rest of the shell.

`-rmdir`

Executing "-rmdir" will remove an existing directory (*Only if it is empty! We use the next command to delete files).

`-rm`

Executing "-rm" will remove/delete an existing file.

`-help`

Executing "-help" will make the shell display commands that it can execute. Executing "-help [command here]" will display an explanation of the command that you are inquiring about.
